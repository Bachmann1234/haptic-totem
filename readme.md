# Haptic Totem

This simple app is to test out an idea I had. I have found that I often find myself in situations where I go into auto pilot. While in auto pilot I find myself making choices I am not super happy about afterwards. This app will trigger the vibation of a Fitbit Ionic in a regular but randomized manner. I am thinking that this will serve as a anchor or reminder to keep my choices concious. I would turn this app on when I find myself about to enter a situation where I know control can be difficult.

The name is inspired by Inception. Where the characters would keep a unique object that they would use to identify if they are in the their own reality and not the dream world.
